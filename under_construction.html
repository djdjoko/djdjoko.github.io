            <p align="center">Welcome to my corner of the internet â€“ currently less "corner office" and more "construction zone". What's cooking? A website so good you'll want to bookmark it twice. But like a fine wine or a really complicated jigsaw puzzle, it needs a bit more time. Imagine this: a website so engaging, you forget why you opened your browser in the first place. That's what I'm building. For now, it's a bit like SchrÃ¶dinger's website â€“ is it amazing? Is it just alright? It's both, until you come back and see for yourself. So, mark your calendar, set a reminder, tie a string around your finger â€“ do whatever it takes to remember to come back. You won't want to miss what's coming.</p>
